"This indicator is computed as the estimated share of urban population who can access a public transport stop within a walking distance of 500 meters (for low capacity public transport systems eg buses) and/or 1000 meters (for high capacity public transport systems eg trains, ferries) along the street network.",,,,,,1421
Only public transport stops which are mapped are included in the analysis which may include both formal and informal stops. Many cities (mostly in the developing countries) have informal public transport systems which are not fully mapped - meaning that they may record higher levels of access to public transport than reported in this dataset. ,,,,,,1422
"Only public transport modes are considered, which do not include taxis",,,,,,1423
"Data on public transport stops is sourced from city maps, OSM, GTFS, UITP, Google, and point mapping in some cities. Estimates by DG REGIO are based on data from OSM, TomTom, NSIs, Eurostat and Copernicus Urban Atlas",,,,,,1424
"Data used to estimate population with access to public transport is based on grid level population disaggregation directly from city/country data, HRSL (Facebook and CIESIN), WorldPop or GHS-Pop.",,,,,,1425
"City/urban area used in the analyis has been generated using a classification approach based on the Urban Extent or the Degree of Urbanization concepts to city definition. As a result, the urban/city area used for the indicator computation in this data table may be larger or smaller than the official municipality boundaries.  The only exception for this is all cities for which estimate source is indicated as National Statitics Office or government ministry (refer to estimate source for each data point)",,,,,,1426
